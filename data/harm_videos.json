Portmap.io offers a free and easy way to expose local services behind NAT or firewall via secure tunnels.,kali_usb_advantages:Installing Kali Linux on a USB flash drive provides flexibility to use on any device without installation. It enhances security by leaving no trace on host machines. Kali comes preloaded with many penetration testing tools. Setup is easy and fast. You can customize tools and update the system directly from the USB.,persistence_benefits:Enabling persistence on Kali USB saves system changes, installed programs, and personal files. This allows you to reuse your custom setup without reconfiguration each time. It makes Kali Linux more practical and flexible.,kali_installation_strength:Kali Linux strength by installation method: USB flash drive: 7/10 — portable and persistent but slower. Hard drive install: 9/10 — fast with full resource use and features. Virtual machine: 8/10 — isolated and easy to switch but slower due to shared resources.",
