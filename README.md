     git clone https://github.com/HARM199/HARM.git
    
    cd HARM
    
    python3 harm.py


           

‚úÖ On Windows:
If Git is not installed on your system:

Go to this website: https://git-scm.com/downloads

Download the Windows version and install it normally (just like any other program).

After installation, open PowerShell or CMD and check if it works by typing:

    git --version

‚úÖ 2. Install Python

If you don‚Äôt have Python:

Download it from: https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/

During installation, make sure to check the option: ‚úÖ ‚ÄúAdd Python to PATH‚Äù

‚úÖ 3. Install required libraries

Open PowerShell or CMD and run these commands one by one:

     pip install pillow

     python -m pip install tk

‚úÖ 4. Download the HARM project from GitHub

     git clone https://github.com/HARM199/HARM.git
     
     cd HARM

‚úÖ 5. Modify the image path for welcome.png

Open the file harm.py for editing using Notepad:

     notepad harm.py
Then find this line (usually around line 186):

      self.original_bg_image = Image.open("/home/kali/Desktop/HARM/images/welcome.png")
And change it to:

      self.original_bg_image = Image.open("images/welcome.png")
